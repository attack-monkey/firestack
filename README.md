# firestack
express + angular + firebase

## This project is still half-baked sorry

Firestack solves the problems of angular + firebase alone - creating an awesome firey stack.  
- Firewire
  - Creates dynamic page & data routes.
  - Makes firebase data available to angular with zero delay and seamlessly switches to realtime data moments later.
