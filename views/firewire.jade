    p firewire uses Express + Angular + Firebase to create a super-quick realtime database wireup.

    p Instead of waiting for firebase to be called by Angular (which can be quite slow to establish), Firewire calls firebase from Express.
    p It then wires the data straight into the client as 
      pre var fw = {...} allowing Abgular to display firebase data immediately.
    p Angular then calls firebase again, seamlessly swapping over to a realtime connection.
